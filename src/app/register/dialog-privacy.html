            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Teambits discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Teambits's behalf or to provide services available at Teambits's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Teambits's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Teambits will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Teambits discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Teambits believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Teambits, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of https://magits.herokuapp.com/ and have supplied your email address, Teambits may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Teambits and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Teambits takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p>If Teambits, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Teambits goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
